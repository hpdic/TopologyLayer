# DFZ:
To complete the study, we need to perform:
(1) Evaluate the state-of-the-art denoising methods on MNIST datasets
(2) Update the metric functions and observe the effectiveness: see topologylayer/nn/features.py

# Point Cloud Examples

`alpha.py` contains examples of point cloud optimization using the weak Alpha complex.  It will reproduce images for Figure 1 in "A Topology Layer for Machine Learning"
